## Overview
In order to show W. Avy that business will be suitable year round in Oahu for a surf and icecream shop we analyzed temperatures in June and December. The temperatures have to be suitable in the cold month of December for this kind of shop as well as the summer months. We analyzed temperatures in these two months and compared them to ensure W. Avy that indeed the surf shop will be sustainable year round.

## Results
There are a couple differences between June and December weather that stand out.
- The mean temperature in June is 74.9 degrees which is about four degrees above the mean temperature in December at 71 degrees.
- The minimum temperatures are the most drastic in difference. In June the minumum temperature is 64 degrees, whereas in December the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. That is a difference of eight degrees.
- In the lower quartile, 25% of temperature in June are 73 degrees and in December 25% of temperatures are 69 degrees. This temperature difference is also four degrees.

## Summary
Overall, the temperatures in June and December do not differ greatly. The maximum temperature for both months is in the 80's and 50% of the temperatures in both months are in the 70's or higher. Both mean values are in the 70's and the lower 25% of temperatures in December are just under 70 degrees. Therefore, I belive the surf shop will be sustainable year round eventhough there could be a few more days in December that are too cold. To analyze the temperatures in Oahu more closely we could look at the months with the most rain or determine the average number of rainy days per month.
